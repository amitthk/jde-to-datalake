* Overview

How do we extract critical business insights from ERP systems without compromising their performance or integrity? This repository we demonstrate through an example how we safely extracted data from JD Edwards ERP into in-house data lake using Apache Airflow. The system implements data validation and compliance checks to ensure data integrity while maintaining minimal impact on ERP performance through non-intrusive extraction methods. The extracted data feeds an Operations Management system for a bakery, enabling real-time time series analytics and business insights while preserving full audit trails for compliance and historical analyses.

Systems like JD Edwards are the backbone of business operations, storing the most accurate financial and operational data at any given moment. However, when you need to unlock deeper insights through time series analysis, diagnostics, and predictive analytics, directly querying the ERP can slow down critical business processes. The sensible approach will be to create a seamless data pipeline that feeds this valuable information into a data lake, where we will then perform complex analytics and support additional business applications without ever touching your production ERP system’s performance. This repository presents a demonstration system - a simplified version of a enterprise data integration platform.

*Note:* All organization-specific information, proprietary business logic, and sensitive configurations have been removed or anonymized. This example system cannot be deployed as-is in a production environment; a real-world implementation would require comprehensive security frameworks, compliance controls, audit mechanisms, performance optimization, and integration with existing enterprise infrastructure.

The system showcases a data pipeline architecture that integrates JD Edwards ERP and operations management systems, specifically demonstrated through a bakery operations use case here. This implementation leverages Apache Airflow as the orchestration engine to create resilient, monitored data pipelines that ensure data integrity while providing real-time visibility into inventory movements and operational metrics.

** Architecture Overview

The architecture (shown in ~images/jde_to_datalake.svg~) shows a multi-tier system for data integration:

[[file:images/jde_to_datalake.svg]]

*** Core Components Explanation

**** JD Edwards ERP Integration Layer
The system connects with JD Edwards through API endpoints to extract inventory data from the Cardex system. This integration handles the task of retrieving inventory movements, stock levels, and product master data while maintaining the integrity of the source ERP system. The JDE helper module (~backend/jde_helper.py~) manages authentication, data extraction, and handles errors properly.

**** Apache Airflow Orchestration Engine
Apache Airflow handles data pipeline orchestration, providing:
- *Scheduled Data Synchronization*: Automated workflows that run at set intervals to keep data fresh
- *Error Handling & Retry Logic*: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling temporary failures
- *Data Lineage Tracking*: Full audit trail of data transformations and movements
- *Monitoring & Alerting*: Real-time view of pipeline health and performance

**** S3 compatible Data Lake Infrastructure
The S3 data lake stores all data assets, organized in a medallion architecture pattern:
- *Bronze Layer*: Raw data with schema-on-read capabilities
- *Silver Layer*: Cleaned and standardized data with data quality rules
- *Gold Layer*: Business-ready datasets optimized for analytics and reporting
- *Audit Trail Storage*: Historical record of all data operations and transformations

**** PostgreSQL Metadata & Control Database
PostgreSQL is used as backend for Aiflow and Compliance dashboard. Besides this it manages the operational metadata including:
- Schema evolution tracking with automatic DDL generation
- Data pipeline execution logs and performance metrics
- User session management and authentication tokens
- Configuration management for dynamic pipeline behavior

**** React.js Compliance Dashboard
The frontend application provides operational oversight:
- Real-time monitoring of data pipeline execution status
- Interactive data validation for outlier detection and correction
- Compliance reporting with drill-down into data lineage
- Manual override capabilities for exception handling

** Airflow Data Pipeline Implementation

The system implements two primary data flow patterns through Airflow DAGs:

*** JDE Cardex to External System Pipeline (~dag_cardex_changes_to_bakery_system.py~)

This pipeline handles the extraction of inventory data from JDE Cardex and transforms it for use by external operational systems:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def get_jde_cardex_with_comparison(bu: str, days_back: int = 5) -> dict:
    """
    Extracts and compares JDE cardex data
    with external system inventory records.
    """
    load_dotenv()
    
    # Calculate extraction window
    today = datetime.now()
    start_date = today - timedelta(days=days_back)
    date_str = start_date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')
    
    print(f"Fetching JDE cardex data for BU {bu} since {date_str}")
    
    # Extract from JDE with error handling
    from jde_helper import get_latest_jde_cardex
    jde_data = get_latest_jde_cardex(bu, date_str)
    
    if not jde_data or 'ServiceRequest1' not in jde_data:
        print(f"No JDE data found for BU {bu}")
        return None
    
    # Transform JDE data structure for downstream processing
    jde_transactions = jde_data['ServiceRequest1']['fs_DATABROWSE_V4111A']['data']['gridData']['rowset']
    df_jde = pd.DataFrame(jde_transactions)
    
    # Parallel extraction from external system
    from bakery_helper import get_data_from_bakery_system
    bakery_system_data = get_data_from_bakery_system()
    
    # Execute data quality validation and unit conversions
    return perform_data_reconciliation(df_jde, bakery_system_data)
#+END_SRC

The pipeline includes unit conversion logic that handles the mapping between JDE's unit of measure system and operational requirements:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def convert_unit_quantity(quantity: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> float:
    """
    Performs unit conversion with validation and error handling.
    Supports conversions like weight-to-volume for different ingredients.
    """
    try:
        # Apply conversion factors based on ingredient properties
        conversion_result = perform_conversion_with_validation(quantity, from_unit, to_unit)
        
        # Log conversion for audit trail
        log_conversion_event(quantity, from_unit, to_unit, conversion_result)
        
        return conversion_result
    except ConversionError as e:
        # Route to manual validation queue
        queue_for_manual_review(quantity, from_unit, to_unit, str(e))
        raise
#+END_SRC

*** External System to JDE Synchronization Pipeline (~dag_bakery_system_to_jde.py~)

This reverse pipeline handles the task of synchronizing consumption data back to JDE for accurate inventory management:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def process_inventory_consumption_batch():
    """
    Processes inventory consumption data
    from operational systems back to JDE for accurate inventory tracking.
    """
    # Extract consumption data with data quality validation
    consumption_data = extract_validated_consumption_data()
    
    # Apply business rules and unit conversions
    processed_data = apply_jde_transformation_rules(consumption_data)
    
    # Execute batch processing with error handling
    for batch in chunk_data_for_processing(processed_data):
        try:
            result = submit_ii_transaction_to_jde(batch)
            log_transaction_result(batch, result)
        except JDETransactionError as e:
            handle_transaction_failure(batch, e)
#+END_SRC

** Data Validation & Compliance Framework

The system includes data validation mechanisms that ensure data integrity throughout the pipeline:

*** Validation Dashboard - JDE Cardex to External System

[[file:images/jde_cardex_to_external_system_validation.png]]

This dashboard (~jde_cardex_to_external_system.png~) provides a checkpoint where data analysts can:
- Review inventory movements extracted from JDE Cardex before synchronization
- Identify and investigate outliers or anomalous data patterns
- Validate unit conversions and quantity calculations
- Approve or reject data batches for downstream processing
- Manually correct data discrepancies with full audit trail

*** Validation Dashboard - External System to JDE

[[file:images/external_system_to_jde_validation.png]]

The reverse validation interface (~external_system_to_jde_validation.png~) enables operators to:
- Map consumption data from operational systems to JDE-compatible formats
- Validate ingredient mappings and unit conversions (e.g., sugar consumption in kg to JDE inventory units)
- Review calculated inventory adjustments before committing to JDE
- Dispatch II (Inventory Issues) transactions to JDE with confidence
- Monitor transaction status and handle exceptions

** Production Considerations & Security Framework

*Important Notice*: This demonstration system has been significantly simplified for educational purposes. A production-ready implementation would require:

*** Security & Compliance
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with multi-factor authentication
- SOX compliance controls for financial data handling
- GDPR/data privacy compliance for customer data
- Audit logging with tamper-evident storage

*** Performance & Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capabilities for high-volume data processing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Database partitioning and indexing optimization
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and alerting

*** Integration & Operations
- Enterprise service bus integration for system-to-system communication
- Comprehensive monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana
- Automated deployment pipelines with CI/CD integration
- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
- Change management and version control for pipeline configurations

The system shows how modern data engineering practices can be applied to ERP integration challenges, demonstrating how Apache Airflow can serve as an orchestration platform for data pipelines while maintaining the operational visibility and control required for business processes.

* System Components

** Backend Services

*** Core Services
The backend infrastructure is built around several integrated services. The FastAPI application serves as the main API server (~backend/main.py~) with built-in internal bakery operations endpoints available at ~/bakeryops/*~. Data lake operations are managed through the S3 helper module (~backend/s3_helper.py~), while schema tracking and versioning is handled by the schema manager (~backend/schema_manager.py~). Integration with JDE systems is provided through the JDE helper (~backend/jde_helper.py~).

*** Helper Modules
Supporting functionality includes the bakery operations helper for API integration (~backend/bakery_ops_helper.py~), JWT-based authentication system (~backend/auth.py~),  user session management (~backend/session_helper.py~), and shared utility functions (~backend/utility.py~).

** Data Pipeline (Airflow DAGs)
The system includes automated data pipeline workflows for data synchronization. The JDE Cardex to Bakery Operations pipeline (~backend/dags/dag_cardex_changes_to_bakery_ops.py~) handles inventory transfers, while the Bakery Operations to JDE synchronization (~backend/dags/dag_bakery_ops_to_jde.py~) manages usage and consumption data flow back to the JDE system.

** Frontend Application
The user interface is built as a React-based dashboard (~ui/src/~) with an organized component structure. The main application component (~App.js~) handles the overall user experience, while the ~components/~ directory contains reusable UI elements for data visualization and user interaction. State management is handled through React context (~context/~), and API configuration is centralized in the ~config/~ directory.

** Database Schema
PostgreSQL serves as the database for metadata tracking and audit trails. The database schema is defined in ~backend/create_bakery_ops_tables.sql~ and includes all necessary tables for tracking system operations, data transformations, and user activities.

* Installation & Setup

** Prerequisites

*** System Requirements
The following software components are required for system operation:

Python version 3.8 or higher is needed for all backend services, while Node.js version 16.x or higher is required for the frontend application. PostgreSQL version 12.x or higher handles metadata and tracking operations. An AWS account is required for S3 data lake functionality, though this is optional during development phases.

*** Development Tools
Several tools are recommended for effective development and system administration:

Version control and collaboration are managed through ~git~, while API testing and debugging can be performed using ~curl~. Database management and queries are handled through ~psql~, and S3 operations require ~aws-cli~ when utilizing cloud storage features.

* Data Flow Patterns

** 1. JDE Cardex Changes → Bakery Operations
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Fetch JDE cardex data
jde_data = get_latest_jde_cardex(business_unit, date_range)

# Transform and enrich
